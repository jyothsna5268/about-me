Jyothsna-1

I am a new member of the fall Batch working on my  Masters of Applied Computer Science.

I am from Vijayawada, India.I completed my under graduation in Computer Science from Bapatla  Women's Engineering College.During the years of study i learnt some technical Knowledge and did a mini project titled "OBJECT ORIENTED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN" but my first brush with serious research was in final year of my undergraduate  course when i successfully completed a project as a part  of curriculum titled "A COCKTAIL APPROACH FOR TRAVEL PACKAGE AND RECOMMENDATION". I also  have participated in various technical seminars and workshop on java.

I am not yet sure of my career plans but i am interested  in Application Development and Full Stack Development. Being a prospective student for new challenging ideas,I believe that an opportunity for higher education in USA would be a unique  fortunity to test and prove my ability and also to enrich and broaden my ken with transition to a new setting.

I always listen to  music in free time , i love to sing and i follow travel and food blogs to know about different cultures through out the world.
